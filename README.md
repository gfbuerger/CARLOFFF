Convective Atmospheres: Linking Radar-based Event Descriptors and Losses From Flash Floods (CARLOFFF)

## Summary

Flash floods are among the most destructive and ubiquitous natural hazards in Central
Europe. Mostly caused by extreme convective rainfall, we still lack a systematic
understanding of how their impacts (in terms of damage to buildings and infrastructure)
are related to the spatiotemporal attributes of the triggering rainfall (duration, spatial
extent, intensity, and location), and the local terrain conditions. To address that gap,
CARLOFFF aims at extracting a comprehensivecatalogue of convective events and their
spatiotemporal attributes from almost 20 years of DWD weather radar data, and at linking
these attributes to an extensive database of reported impacts from various sources.
Furthermore, we attempt to map the regional occurrence of such impact-relevant events to
large-scale atmospheric conditions (as represented by climate reanalyses). On that basis,
it might be possible to detect past and future changes in both frequency and intensity of
impact-relevant atmospheric conditions.
